databases work very well with when you get into terabytes and petabytes that RDBMSes tend to break If you are foreseeing that kind of something like HBase or Cassandra may be what the doctor If spend some quality time tuning your inserting caching layers%
of your standard containing navigation and the prize our would you determine what information on a is the primary data in an automated would probably try something like in all links to same website from that all links and build a DOM tree for each URL should help you come up with redundant contents templates and DOM trees for all documents on same site all redundant nodes navigational ads and such to identify similar nodes and strip if largest unique text blocks that are not to be found in other DOMs on that website unique as candidate for further approach of doing it seems pretty promising because it would be fairly simple to but still have good potential to be even to complex Web pages that make excessive use of because it would identify similiar HTML nodes in between all pages on the same could probably be further improved by simpling using a scoring system to keep track of DOM nodes that were previously identified to contain unique so that these nodes are prioritized for other%

will happily take a SQL timestamp and convert it to UNIX that it is bad practice to not use quotes around your array to the use quotes around a string literal array For is while is is but it The reason is that this code has an undefined constant rather than a string notice the PHP may in future define constants unfortunately for such have the same It works because PHP automatically converts a bare string unquoted string which does not correspond to any known into a string which contains the bare For if there is no defined constant named then PHP will substitute in the string and use%

suspect the spike is because you have the interpolation mode cranked right All interpolation modes work per pixel and BiCubic High Quality is about as high as you can go with so I suspect the per pixel calculations are chewing up your a test try dropping the interpolation mode down to and see if the CPU spike drops if so then your so then do some trial and error for cost vs chances are you might not need High Quality BiCubic to get decent%
I prefer to wire stuff up It is pretty simple to run stored procs to retrieve data and assign it to data entry controls without using data It is also easy to grab the modified data and or delete as The data source classes add what seems to me to be an unnecessary extra If they were significantly simpler than the way I do it I might give them a but they seem pretty complex to even though I have any benchmark data to prove it seems they must be less%

so everyone has decided for good strait SQL is of the This leaves us with many methods of placing a in our code to separate our code from the I am now going to spit out all the info I have gathered in the hope someone can set me strait and tell me what I ORM is a series of tools or tightly integrated which maps database rows to objects in the an AR is a type of ORM in which a database table or view is wrapped into a thus an object instance is tied to a single row in the mapping is a type of ORM that is the process of creating data element mappings between two distinct data three claim to work like new with a User class something like User extends Model Specify the database protected Define your protected this setup you can easily fetch rows without the need to write AR classes actually look more like now this is where it gets Everyone and his brother seems to have a different view on what type of code falls While most agree that an AR or DM is a type of ORM but sometimes the lines that tell from seem to wrote a class that uses a single object in which you make calls to this object and it handles SQL creation for result the them the question is is and why people agree on these is the difference between a%

a similar vein to other but taking a slightly more generic approach why not create a class that can wrap an existing IEnumerable implementation and calculate the statistic as it passes other items a class I just threw together but you could create variations for other kinds of aggregation class public int Count private public mSource Count public foreach T in yield return IEnumerator foreach T in yield return private could create three instances of to wrap counting the total number of to wrap counting the number of matching to wrap counting the number of matching key with this approach is that not layering multiple responsibilities onto your existing the method only handles the not asking it to track stats as in response to a comment by final code would look something like files new matchingFiles new files contents matchingFiles linesFound new contents var lineText in linesFound lineText message matches in matching Scanned that this is still a functional approach the variables used are like than and the overall function has no%
